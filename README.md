[![Review Assignment Due Date](https://classroom.github.com/assets/deadline-readme-button-22041afd0340ce965d47ae6ef1cefeee28c7c493a6346c4f15d667ab976d596c.svg)](https://classroom.github.com/a/wOo27OxG)

This repo/site is for HW3 of UC Berkeley STAT159/259. For this assignment we tidied the project files into `audio`, `figures`, and `data` sub-directories for organization. We also made `ligotools` an installable package with 2 modules, `readligo` and `utils` both of which have respective tests. We included a `Makefile` with targets `env`, `html`, and `clean` which makes setup and cleanup easier, for example in usage with Binder which we also set up. Finally we deployed the repo as a MyST site through GitHub Pages which auto-updates through a configuration with GitHub Actions.

The foundational notebook and other files come from [LIGO Center for Open Science Tutorial Repository](https://github.com/losc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial).
